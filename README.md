# Edge ideas
### directed
- x speaks before y
  - when x has a line before y, breaks when character is null (description text)
  - gives a rough model of x speaks to y, but this is not perfect
- x mentions y
  - when x mentions y in their line
### undirected
- x and y have lines in the same episode
- x and y have lines in the same book

# Cleanup
made a list of characters and removed any character that does not have 
a page on https://avatar.fandom.com. then used this website to fill in 
the gender, their power and their origin. Used these "approved" characters
to clean up my other datasets
